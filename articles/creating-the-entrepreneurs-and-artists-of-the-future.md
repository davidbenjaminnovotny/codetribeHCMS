Coding teaches you how to think, but that’s not all.

If practiced within a real-world environment and with targeted outcomes, the learner can go **beyond concepts** and into creative and technical understanding.

`Coding teaches you how to think, but that’s not all.`

CodeTribe’s value proposition lies squarely in providing **real-world skills** that provide a coding foundation for any entrepreneur or employee. These can be used in building, modifying or simply working with online tools or services.

**How?**
